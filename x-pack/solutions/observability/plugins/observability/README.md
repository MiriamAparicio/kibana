# Observability plugin

This plugin provides shared components and services for use across observability solutions, as well as the observability landing page UI.

## Rules, Alerts, and Cases

In order to have alert data indexed
you'll need to enable writing in the [Rule Registry plugin](../rule_registry/README.md):

```yaml
xpack.ruleRegistry.write.enabled: true
```

When this is set to `true`, your alerts should show on the alerts page.

## Shared navigation

The Observability plugin maintains a navigation registry for Observability solutions, and exposes a shared page template component. Please refer to the docs in [the component directory](public/components/shared/page_template) for more information on registering your solution's navigation structure, and rendering the navigation via the shared component.

## Exploratory view component

A shared component for visualizing observability data types via lens embeddable. [For further details.](./public/components/shared/exploratory_view/README.md)

## Unit testing

Note: Run the following commands from `kibana/x-pack/plugins/observability`.

### Run unit tests

```bash
npx jest --watch
```

### Update snapshots

```bash
npx jest --updateSnapshot
```

### Coverage

HTML coverage report can be found in target/coverage/jest after tests have run.

```bash
open target/coverage/jest/index.html
```

## API integration testing

API tests are separated in two suites:

- a basic license test suite
- a trial license test suite (the equivalent of gold+)

This requires separate test servers and test runners.

### Basic

```
# Start server
node scripts/functional_tests_server --config x-pack/solutions/observability/test/observability_api_integration/basic/config.ts

# Run tests
node scripts/functional_test_runner --config x-pack/solutions/observability/test/observability_api_integration/basic/config.ts
```

The API tests for "basic" are located in `x-pack/solutions/observability/test/observability_api_integration/basic/tests`.

### Trial

```
# Start server
node scripts/functional_tests_server --config x-pack/solutions/observability/test/observability_api_integration/trial/config.ts

# Run tests
node scripts/functional_test_runner --config x-pack/solutions/observability/test/observability_api_integration/trial/config.ts
```

The API tests for "trial" are located in `x-pack/solutions/observability/test/observability_api_integration/trial/tests`.

### API test tips

- For debugging access Elasticsearch on `http://localhost:9220` (elastic/changeme)
- To update snapshots append `--updateSnapshots` to the functional_test_runner command
